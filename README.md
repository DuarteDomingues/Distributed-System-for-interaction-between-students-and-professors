Application for sending and receiving instant messages (chats), to facilitate communication in the curricular units running in a school, 
assuming that both users (students and teachers) use individual equipment (mobile or fixed) to access the local network.

XML is used as the communication medium between the server and its clients. The data storage will be done using XML files, using java tools to write and 
and read these documents. XSD will be used to validate the existing data and XML communications.

For the communication between server and client sockets will be used and for the transport layer the TCP protocol will be used due to its fidelity.
