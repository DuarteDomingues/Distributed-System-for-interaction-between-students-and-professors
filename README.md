Application for sending and receiving instant messages (chats), to facilitate communication in the curricular units running in a school, 
assuming that both users (students and teachers) use individual equipment (mobile or fixed) to access the local network.

XML is used as the communication medium between the server and its clients. The data storage will be done using XML files, using java tools to write and 
and read these documents. XSD will be used to validate the existing data and XML communications.

For the communication between server and client sockets will be used and for the transport layer the TCP protocol will be used due to its fidelity.

 In the first project a graphical interface was developed for the different user functionalities, using java swing.

In the second project a Web application was developed that is able to transmit and receive 
information from a user to a server, over the Internet.

In order to generate dynamic web pages capable of interpreting and displaying the received messages 
visually appealing to the user, JavaServer Pages and client-side technologies 
technologies (Javascript and CSS) were used.
